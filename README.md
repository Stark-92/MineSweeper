# MineSweeper XamarinForms Visual Studio 2015
This project follows MVVM pattern for GUI development 

Mine Sweeper is a single-player mind game.
The objective is to clear a rectangular mine field containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in the revealed cells.
You tap to reveal a cell and double tap on a cell to plant/remove a flag marking suspicious mine.
You win if all the cells not containing mines are revealed. You lose if you reveal a cell containing a mine.
